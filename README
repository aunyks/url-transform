# url-transform
A node module to transform URLs.

## Installation
This module is based on [url-parse](https://github.com/unshiftio/url-parse) and is therefore designed to be used with either browserify or Node.js.
```bash
npm install url-transform
```

## Usage
All examples assume the module is bootstrapped using:
```javascript
'use strict'

var transform = require('url-transform');
```
